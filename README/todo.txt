- change flags.png and flags.css like iccup

- server/status - server status page

- paging players and games using kohana examples.php

- auto detect user agent language (use en_US if language is not found)

- sql tables with game history (games_warcraft3, games_dota, games_starcraft, games_diablo, games_diablo2)

- sql script to migrate hwreports from 2.x to 3.x
    i think to do this changes:
	in the games player id's (it was names)
	new table maps_starcraft with map names and map id in the gameinfo (remove map, mapauth, mapsize, tileset)
	player result codes (0 - DRAW | 1 - WIN | 2 - LOSS | 3 - DISCONNECT | 4 - UNKNOWN)
	player race codes (0 - Unknown | 1 - Terran | 2 - Protoss | 3 - Zerg)
	probability type is float (it was string)
	new "date" field (when game was added)

    It should listen tcp portm recieve commands and output xml back to client
    Use cash (save xml chars to directory) and check characters checksum before new parse
