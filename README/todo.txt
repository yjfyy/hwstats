TODAY:
- routing
- views
- display player list
- display player profile
- coutry flags
    * jquery + google api
    * alter bnet table to create country_code field
    * code: if (cc is null or player_ip == visitor_ip) update cc;


- routing examples
    warcraft3/playerlist/{pageId} - page with statistics
    starcraft/profile/playerName - player profile page
    starcraft/gamelist/playerId/{pageId} - all games for player
    starcraft/gameinfo/gameId - one game info
    server/status - server status page

- stats and games page navigation using kohana examples.php

+ multi language support
- auto detect user agent language (use en_US if language is not found)
- geoip support (ip as country flag image)

- visual styles support
- sql tables with game history (games_warcraft3, games_dota, games_starcraft, games_diablo, games_diablo2)

- sql script to migrate hwreports from 2.x to 3.x
    i think to do this changes:
	in the games player id's (it was names)
	new table maps_starcraft with map names and map id in the gameinfo (remove map, mapauth, mapsize, tileset)
	player result codes (0 - DRAW | 1 - WIN | 2 - LOSS | 3 - DISCONNECT | 4 - UNKNOWN)
	player race codes (0 - Unknown | 1 - Terran | 2 - Protoss | 3 - Zerg)
	probability type is float (it was string)
	new "date" field (when game was added)
